## Exactly

Exactly is a new decentralized, non-custodial and open-source protocol that will provide an autonomous interest rate market to lenders and borrowers while setting interest rates based on credit supply and demand, enabling users to frictionlessly exchange the time value of their crypto assets at both variable and fixed interest rates for the first time in DeFi.

Aside from taking loans and making deposits at variable interest rates from a Variable Rate Pool, this protocol enables users to do so at fixed rates as well through the interaction with several Fixed Rate Pools, each one representing a specific maturity date. Interest rates are determined based on the credit utilization rate of each Fixed Rate Pool.

We are not your typical startup, we are fully remote and working to scale Exactly as the biggest decentralized credit platform on earth.

Exactly welcomes all qualified persons on planet earth to apply regardless of race, religion, political orientation, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

If you are a self-directed individual who puts collective success above your own and are motivated by solving hard problems with big potential impact, you will fit right in. Compensation will be super competitive and commensurate with experience.
