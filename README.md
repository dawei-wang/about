# About us

Everything there is to know so far about [Exactly](https://exact.ly):

We are building decentralized, non-custodial and open-source protocol that will provide an autonomous interest rate market to lenders and borrowers while setting interest rates based on credit supply and demand, enabling users to frictionlessly exchange the time value of their crypto assets at both variable and fixed interest rates for the first time in DeFi.

While the short term focus is to bring fixed income solutions to DeFi, the team's long term vision is to connect DeFi to the legacy financial world.

Exactly is funded by long term capital partners with a track record of alignment with the Tech and DeFi ecosystems.
